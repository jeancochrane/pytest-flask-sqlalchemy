.. Originally : Supported Back Ends

So far, pytest-flask-sqlalchemy has been most extensively tested against PostgreSQL 9.6.
It should theoretically work with any backend that is supported by SQLAlchemy, but Postgres is the only backend that is currently tested by the test suite.

Official support for SQLite and MySQL is `planned for a future release <https://github.com/jeancochrane/pytest-flask-sqlalchemy/issues/3>`_.
In the meantime, if you're using one of those backends and you run in to problems, we would greatly appreciate your help! `Open an issue <https://github.com/jeancochrane/pytest-flask-sqlalchemy/issues/new>`_ if something isn't working as you expect.
